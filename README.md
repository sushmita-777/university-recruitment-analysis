# University Recruitment Analysis

## Background & Overview

The Domestic Recruitment team of a Canadian University wants to understand the performance of their UnderGraduate programs which primarily have students living in North American region as their major applicants.

This analysis will then help to align the efforts of University representatives accordingly and plan future recruitment drives

We are given 2020 and 2021 application **dummy data** to prepare our report for this analysis

#### Dataset Information

1. The data has 2397 students applications across 6 faculty Groups
2. All programs offered have been taken onto consideration
3. There are 10 territories across which University representatives can be allocated
4. Important columns include Student Demographics, Programs Applied, Intake, and Offer Status for a program

The 2 datasets with updated data from April 5 and June 6 have been added to the dashboard

### Overview of Applications and Offer Status

Here the objective is to understand the overall status of the Applications  submitted to the University across all programs. 
The primary metric we need to analyze here is how many offers have been accepted and declined. 



**Key Insights from the above Dashboard**
1. ~500 new applications received between April 5 and June 6
2. 34% of new offers were given to students

**Application Distribution across Months**
Most applications come between December and January

**Offer Status Funnel**
We analyze the Offer Conversion Funnel as of June 6 and April 5

## Territory Performance

In this Dashboard, our objective is to understand the distribution of Applications across the 10 territories and where most 
of the students accept their offers.



**Key Insights from the above Dashboard**
1. North American and South Asian Region students prefer to study bachelor Programs at our University
2. South Asian students start applying as early as September while NA region students apply starting in October. 

**Application based on Student Citizenship**
India, China, Bangladesh, and Nigeria are the top 4 territories with 80% of applications to the University.
These students are mostly residing in the NA region.

**Application Confirmation across Territories**
Even though NA regions students apply in large numbers, their offer acceptance is shallow as compared to South Asian and West African region students

## Programs Performance

In this Dashboard, we aim to understand how various programs are performing and which programs are popular among students 



**Key Insights from the above Dashboard**
1. Faculty of Science is the most applied Bachelor Program in the University
followed by the Faculty of Arts & Humanities, Faculty of Engineering, and Odette Business School.

2. Computer Science with Co-op and General and BComm in Business Administration with Co-op and General are the top 4 popular programs among the students who apply to the University

3. Faculty of Science, which offers the top 4 above-mentioned popular programs gets at least 33% applications from each territory 


## University Representative Planning

The dashboard below will help us understand the application status at a city pincode level. we understand the regions of importance from where students apply and get offers.

We also try to figure out areas of opportunities so that University representatives can be allocated accordingly
